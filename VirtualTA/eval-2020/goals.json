    "I want to understand how to implement parallel algorithms in C++ using the execution policies defined in the Extensions for Parallelism, and I would like examples of both the parallelized versions of existing algorithms and the new algorithms introduced in this standard.",
    "I want to understand how to effectively use `std::reference_wrapper` in my C++ code, particularly in scenarios where I need to store references in standard containers or pass them to functions."
